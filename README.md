## üìå Supported Algorithms

- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)**  
  Reduces dimensionality by transforming variables into a set of linearly uncorrelated principal components.

- **Truncated Singular Value Decomposition (SVD)**  
  Approximates SVD by retaining only the most significant singular values, making it suitable for sparse and large-scale datasets.

       virtualenv \
       python3-pip

2. **Configure environment variables**:
    Add the following lines to `.bashrc` or your environment configuration file to set up CUDA paths:
    ```bash
    export CUDA_HOME=/usr/local/cuda
    export PATH=$CUDA_HOME/bin:$PATH
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH_MORE=/home/$USER/lib/:$CUDA_HOME/lib64/:$CUDA_HOME/lib/:$CUDA_HOME/lib64:$CUDA_HOME/extras/CUPTI/lib64
    export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$LD_LIBRARY_PATH:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH_MORE
    export CUDADIR=/usr/local/cuda/include/
    ```

3. **Compile the project and install the Python interface**:
    ```bash
    git clone --recursive git@github.com:navdeep-G/dimreduce4gpu.git
    cd dimreduce4gpu
    virtualenv -p python3.6 env
    make
    ```
